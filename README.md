*The script performs real-time stock price retrieval from Yahoo Finance. 
*The script iterates through a list of stock codes, retrieves the current price and change information from the Yahoo Finance website, and stores the data in a structured format. 
*I have implemented a function to save the gathered data to a CSV file, ensuring data integrity by checking for duplicates before appending new entries. 
*This project showcases my expertise in web scraping, data manipulation, and file handling using Python. It also highlights my ability to work with external libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Pandas to streamline data extraction and processing.
